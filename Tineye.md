## Handbook

Allomancers who burn tin have greatly increased physical senses. Known as Tineyes, they excel at scouting dangerous locations or investigating crimes. Most groups or crews will recruit a Tineye to provide safety for their operations.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Armor:** Medium armor, shields
-   **Weapons:** Shortswords, scimitars, longswords, and rapiers
-   **Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence
-   **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Insight, Medicine, Religion, Perception, and Survival.

#### Tin Burn

At 1st Focus level, you can burn tin as detailed by your Allomancy feature to heighten your senses. You can spend 1 charge as a bonus action to begin burning tin. The tin burn lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early as a bonus action, lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), fall unconscious, die. While burning tin, you gain the following benefits:

-   The range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.
-   When you roll for initiative, you can add a bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
-   You can add a bonus to your Passive Perception and Wisdom (Perception) checks equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
-   You can see through lightly obscured environments and they do not impose disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks you make that rely on sight.

If you are affected by any overpowering sensory stimuli (such as a loud noise or bright light) while burning tin, you also make a saving throw to maintain concentration. Overpowering stimuli are especially strong and normally require an action to create.

#### Tin Flare

At 2nd Focus level, you can flare tin for additional power. On your turn, if you are burning tin, you may choose to spend 3 additional charges (no action required) and increase it to a flare, which lasts until the start of your next turn. While flaring tin, you gain the benefits of tin burn through the Tineye feature, in addition to the following benefits:

-   Attacks rolls made against you have disadvantage.
-   You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Insight) checks you make.
-   The range of your darkvision increases by another 30 feet.
-   You have blindsight up to 10 feet.

While you are flaring tin, the minimum DC for the saving throw made to maintain your tin burn is 15. On a failure, you immediately stop burning tin and you are incapacitated until the end of your next turn.

#### Tin Sense

At 2nd Focus level, your Allomancy gives you an edge in dodging away from danger. While burning tin, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects you can see or hear, such as traps and Allomancy. You cannot be incapacitated to gain this benefit.

#### Tinsight

Starting at 3rd Focus level, you can try to analyze your opponents’ moves. As a bonus action, you can roll a Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see or hear within 30 feet, contested by the creature’s Charisma (Deception). On a success, you deal additional damage to the creature for the next minute, or until you can no longer see or hear the creature. You can only deal this bonus damage once per turn and the attack must use a finesse or ranged weapon.

The extra damage is 1d6 and increases by another 1d6 at 9th Focus level. If you are burning tin when you deal this damage, the number of extra damage dice is doubled. If you are flaring tin, the number of extra damage dice is tripled instead.

#### Sensory Shock

Beginning at 3rd Focus level, when you are stunned, you can use a bonus action to spend 2 charges and end the effect.

#### Improved Burn

When you reach 7th Focus level, you burn your metals more efficiently. While out of combat, your tin burn lasts 10 minutes instead of 1 minute.

#### Heightened Senses

Starting at 7th Focus level, you gain proficiency in the Perception skill and you can make a Wisdom (Perception) check as a bonus action.

While you are flaring tin, you can double your proficiency bonus to any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make.
