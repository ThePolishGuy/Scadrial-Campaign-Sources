## History
As the Deepness gained strength and caused more problems, The Lord Ruler(Az Uralkodó) conquered the world then traveled to the Well of Ascension, to defeat the Deepness. There he took the power held in the well, and killed the Deepness. 

After his victory Scadrial changed. The Ashmounts became active and started pumping large amounts of ash into the athmosphere, resulting in regular ashfalls. All the plants became brown to adapt to the new environment. 

These changes didn't affect the Lord Ruler's plan, he conquered the whole continent and established the Final Empire, with Luthadel as it's capital. The Lord Ruler became immortal and has been ruling over these lands for more than a millennia.

## Culture
The Lord Ruler suppressed most technological advances, killing everyone who discovered gunpowder and the knowledge associated with it. He did allow some advances such as the implementation of canneries, allowing for the easy storage of food. The currency includes Boxings and Clips.

The Final Empire had somewhere around a hundred million citizens. A couple million of those lived in Luthadel.

#### Military
The empire had a standing army around Luthadel including a number of garrisons. The Luthadel Garrison consisted of twenty thousand troops, mostly skaa, and many of the smaller towns in the Central Dominance had smaller Garrisons of their own, such as Valtroux and Holstep. There is also a substantial army of koloss who can be under the control of the Lord Ruler or a remote Inquisitor. The Canton of Inquisition itself is trained to have formidable warriors, each member more than capable of overcoming any target. The Noble houses operate guardsmen, militias and armies when necessary.

#### Social Caste
The descendants of the people who originally supported the Lord Ruler during his rise to power are now the nobility of the Final Empire. The Lord Ruler and his allies gained the ability of Allomancy. There is a wide range of nobles, from the high houses to the impoverished.

Skaa descend from people who did not support the Lord Ruler. Skaa cannot become Allomancers unless they have noble blood recently in their lineage. Skaa are essentially slaves, property for nobles to exchange between them, although they are ultimately owned by the Lord Ruler. The best-off skaa will be craftsmen or tradesmen. They and their families will live in relative comfort, but this happens very rarely for skaa. Normally, even the highest skaa are subject to the whims of the nobility. However, far from the center of the empire, skaa can own land and achieve wealth.

#### Government
The Steel Ministry and its obligators are the main bureaucracy for the Final Empire. Despite officially being a religious institution, in reality the Steel Ministry was based on the bureaucratic mercantile system of the Hallant. The main purpose of this bureaucracy was to monitor the noble houses who engaged in financial activity under this system. The noble houses themselves were primarily financial organizations in nature. They also maintained the Lord Ruler's empire from their keeps. The Great Houses control most trade and enslave most of the Empire's skaa population.

The structure of Dominances, in our time, involves provincial lords each with command of, and responsibility for, their own skaa. This organization has been in place for two hundred years and grants the nobility greater freedom than previous systems. The Lord Ruler seems to be uncomfortable with this and counteracts it with increased obligator activity.

## Luthadel
Located in the center of the Central Dominance, Luthadel was the cultural and political center of the Final Empire during the Lord Ruler's reign. Interestingly, Luthadel was not particularly advanced technologically, likely due to the Lord Ruler's continuing efforts to suppress technological development.

Luthadel was also unique in the Final Empire in that it was the only city allowed to have a city wall. While a few other cities had natural fortifications (Fadrex City, for example, was surrounded by rocky outcroppings that acted as a natural barrier against attack), the Lord Ruler only allowed man made fortifications around his city. Interestingly, this wall seems to have acted more as a status symbol than actual defense, since the 8 gates were spaced roughly equidistant around the perimeter, and the height of the wall was not sufficient to prevent Koloss from scaling the wall once enough of their bodies lay at its base.

Luthadel also sits next to a lake bearing the name of Lake Luthadel
