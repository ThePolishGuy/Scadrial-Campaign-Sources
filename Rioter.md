## Handbook

Allomancers who burn zinc gain the ability to riot and amplify the feelings of a creature. Called Rioters, they are often charismatic and egotistic because they can bend almost anyone to their will. If Rioters do not exert self-control, even their friends will grow to distrust them.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Weapons:** Dueling canes, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords
-   **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
-   **Skills:** Choose three from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Insight, Perception, Performance, and Persuasion.

#### Zinc Rioting

Starting at 1st Focus level, you can burn zinc as detailed by your Allomancy feature to influence another creature’s emotions and will. The creature must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, and cannot be a construct or undead.

When you force a creature make a saving throw as a result of rioting, the saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Riot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Charisma modifier

Your Riot range is 30 feet. This range increases to 40 feet at 7th Focus level.

#### Manipulate Emotions

Starting at 1st Focus level, you learn to riot certain emotions to your advantage. You can spend 1 charge as an action to target a number of creatures you can see equal to half your Focus level.

An affected target must make a Wisdom saving throw. It has advantage on the save if you or your allies are fighting it, or if it is already charmed, frightened or otherwise affected by another strong emotion. On a failed save, you have advantage on one Charisma check you make to interact with the creature within the next minute. The creature has advantage on saving throws to resist further rioting attempts for the next hour.

After each successful save, the creature can choose to make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine its mood had been influenced.

#### Stoke the Flames

Beginning at 1st Focus level, you can briefly inspire your allies. As a bonus action, choose a creature other than you within your Riot range that can hear you. For the next minute, when the creature rolls a total of 20 or higher on a melee attack roll and hits, it can roll one additional weapon damage die, and this benefit ends.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain expended uses on a short or long rest.

#### Zinc Flare

Starting at 2nd Focus level, you can flare zinc. Whenever you spend charges of zinc, you can instead spend 4 times as many charges to flare it. Until the end of your turn, you impose disadvantage on all saving throws a target makes against your Riot save DC, but the target knows it had been influenced when the rioting ends.

#### Beguiling Glamor

Beginning at 2nd Focus level, while you are wearing no armor and not wileding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

#### Zinc Aspect

At 3rd Focus level, you learn special ways to riot a creature’s emotions, which are represented by the Aspects listed below.

As an action, you can spend 1 charge to use a Zinc Aspect and target eligible creatures within range that can see or hear you. When the effects end, the target knows it had been influenced when the rioting ends. If an Aspect forced a target to make a saving throw, the target has advantage on saving throws made to resist the same Aspect for the next hour.

If you use an Aspect requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), you cannot another Aspect that requires concentration.

You learn five Zinc Aspects of your choice and you learn one additional Zinc Aspect at 7th Focus level. Each time you gain a Focus level in this subclass, you can replace one Aspect you already know with a different one.
-   _**Riot Anguish.**_ The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is charmed for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). While restrained, the target can make a Strength saving throw at the end of its turn, taking 2d4 necrotic damage on a failure or ending the effect on a success.
-   _**Riot Arrogance.**_ The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 psychic damage and the next attack roll made against it before the end of your next turn has advantage. If you flare zinc to use this Aspect, you roll twice as many dice for damage.
-   _**Riot Betrayal.**_ The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for one minute. While charmed, it must use its action on its next turn to move and make one melee attack against a creature other than itself that you choose. At the end of its turn, an affected target can repeat the saving throw to end the effect. The target has advantage on its saving throws if you or your allies are currently fighting it, and automatically succeeds it does not have a creature to attack.
-   _**Riot Compassion.**_ The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is charmed for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) or your allies do anything harmful to it. The creature has advantage on the saving throw if you or your allies are currently fighting it. While charmed, the creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance and tries its best to assist you without being harmed.
-   _**Riot Dread.**_ As part of the action used for this Aspect, you must make a weapon attack against the target or this Aspect fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and both the target and another creature of your choice within 10 feet of it takes 1d8 psychic damage. The bonus damage increases to 2d8 at 7th Focus level.

-   _**Riot Fatigue.**_ The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes 2d8 psychic damage and its speed is reduced by half until the start of your next turn. The damage increases to 3d8 at 11th Focus level, and 4d8 at 18th Focus level. If you flare zinc to use this Aspect, you roll twice as many dice for damage.
-   _**Riot Fear.**_ The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. This condition ends early until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) or if the target cannot see you. At the end of its turn, the affected target can repeat the saving throw to end the effect.
-   _**Riot Greed.**_ Up to 2 targets you choose must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, each target is enthralled by an object you choose and have disadvantage on Perception checks for the next minute or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). You can affect one additional creature when you reach 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th Focus levels.

-   _**Riot Pain.**_ The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d8 psychic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 2d12 psychic damage. The damage increases by one die when you reach 11th Focus level (3d8 or 3d12) and 18th Focus level (4d8 or 4d12). If you flare zinc to use this Aspect, you roll twice as many dice for damage.

If it ends its movement within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as a reaction. You can force the target to move up to 20 feet at 11th Focus level, and 30 feet at 18th Focus level.
-   _**Riot Shock.**_ Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or it takes 2d6 psychic damage and cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn. The damage increases to 3d6 at 11th Focus level, and 4d6 at 18th Focus level. If you flare zinc to use this Aspect, you roll twice as many dice for damage.
-   _**Riot Suffering.**_ As part of the action used for this Aspect, you must make a weapon attack against the target or this Aspect fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects and takes 1d10 bonus psychic damage. The bonus damage increases to 2d10 at 11th Focus level and 3d10 at 18th Focus level. If you flare zinc to use this Aspect, you roll twice as many dice for damage.

#### Listen to Me

When you reach 7th Focus level, you naturally influence others to become more agreeable. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures equal to half your Focus level within range that can hear and understand you, and suggest a reasonable course of action for them. Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Riot save DC or it must follow the suggestion to the best of its ability for up to 1 hour. If the suggestion is unreasonable or harmful, the influence fails. If you or any of your companions damage the targets, the influence immediately ends.

You can continue to make additional suggestions before the duration ends. Each time you do, an affected creature repeats the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature follows the new suggestion. On a success, the effect ends and the creature immediately becomes hostile.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
