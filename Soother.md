## Handbook

Allomancers who burn brass gain the ability to soothe or dampen the feelings of other creatures. Although they often use their powers to calm and relieve stress, they are still capable of emotionally manipulating their foes. Known as Soothers, they often work with Rioters to control massive crowds from both angles.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Armor:** Medium armor, shields
-   **Weapons:** Martial weapons
-   **Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma
-   **Skills:** Choose three from Animal Handling, Arcana, Deception, History, Insight, Medicine, Performance, and Persuasion

#### Brass Soothing

Starting at 1st Focus level, you can burn brass as detailed by your Allomancy feature to influence another creature’s emotions and will. The creature must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, and cannot be a construct or undead.

When you force a creature make a saving throw as a result of soothing, the saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Soothe save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Your Soothe range is 10 feet. This range increases to 20 feet at 7th Focus level.

#### Manipulate Emotions

Starting at 1st Focus level, you learn to soothe certain emotions to your advantage. You can spend 1 charge as an action to target a number of creatures you can see equal to half your Focus level.

An affected target must make a Wisdom saving throw. It has advantage on the save if you or your allies are fighting it, or if it is already charmed, frightened or otherwise affected by another strong emotion. On a failed save, you have advantage on one Charisma check you make to interact with the creature within the next minute. The creature has advantage on saving throws to resist further soothing attempts for the next hour.

After each successful save, the creature can choose to make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine its mood had been influenced.

#### Calming Words

Starting at 1st Focus level, you can calm the hostility in others. As an an action, you can choose any number of creatures within range. Each creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or immediately cease hostility to creatures you choose for up to 1 minute. A creature can choose to fail the saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain expended uses on a long rest.

#### Brass Flare

Starting at 2nd Focus level, you can flare brass. Whenever you spend charges of brass, you can instead spend 4 times as many charges to flare it. Until the end of your turn, you impose disadvantage on all saving throws a target makes against your Soothe save DC, but the target knows it had been influenced when the rioting ends.

Additionally, if you flare brass to use your Calming Words feature, you can remove your choice of frightened or charmed conditions from your targets.

#### Calm the Fire

When you reach 2nd Focus level, you can speak words to calm your allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear you speak regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points becomes a d8 when you reach 7th Focus level.

#### Brass Aspect

At 3rd Focus level, you learn ways to soothe negative emotions from your allies, which are represented by the Aspects listed below.

You can spend 1 charge as a bonus action to use a Brass Aspect. You and each creature within range temporarily gains the benefit detailed by the Aspect you chose. The benefit lasts until the start of your next turn, after which it disappears.

At the end of each long rest, you can prepare three Brass Aspects of your choice from the following list to use throughout the day:
-   _**Stay Agile.**_ The target has a bonus to Dexterity and Charisma checks and saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). If you flare brass to use this feature, the bonus instead equals double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).
-   _**Stay Determined.**_ The target gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). If you flare brass to use this feature, the temporary hit points equal double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) instead.
-   _**Stay Focused.**_ The target has a bonus to Intelligence and Wisdom checks equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). If you flare brass to use this feature, the bonus instead equals double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).
-   _**Stay Nimble.**_ The target’s speed increases by 10 feet, and opportunity attacks made against the target have disadvantage. When you flare brass to use this feature, the target’s speed increases by 20 feet instead.
-   _**Stay Strong.**_ The target has a bonus to Strength and Constitution checks equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). If you flare brass to use this feature, the bonus instead equals double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).

#### Focus the Pain

Starting at 3rd Focus level, you can briefly soothe all feelings but pain from your targets. Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can spend 1 charge to deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage. If you have dealt damage to this creature on your previous turn, you can deal this damage without spending a charge.

The additional damage increases to 2d8 at 9th Focus level. If you flare brass to use this feature, you roll twice as many bonus damage dice instead.

#### Of Sound Mind

Beginning at 7th Focus level, when you make an Intelligence check, you can add your Charisma modifier to the roll.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
