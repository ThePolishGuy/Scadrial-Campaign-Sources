## Handbook

Allomancers who burn bronze have the ability to detect Allomantic pulses. Called Seekers, they relentlessly track their targets and often work as as Allomancer bounty hunters. Seeing one stalking through a city can strike fear into the hearts of anyone.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Armor:** Medium armor, shields
-   **Weapons:** Martial weapons
-   **Saving Throws:** Strength, Wisdom
-   **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, Stealth, and Survival

#### Detect Allomancy

Starting at 1st Focus level, you can burn bronze as detailed by your Allomancy feature. You can spend 1 charge as an action to open your awareness to Allomancy. You discover the presence of any Allomancy within 60 feet of you unless it is copper or otherwise masked by a coppercloud.

You perceive Allomancy as invisible pulsing pushes and pulls, which provide the following information:

-   The number and direction of Allomantic sources
-   The direction of each Allomantic source
-   Whether the Allomantic source metal is currently flared

Your seeking range increases to 120 feet at 11th Focus level and 300 feet at 18th Focus level.

#### Seeker’s Eye

At 1st Focus level, you learn to defend against specific types of Allomancy. At the end of a short or long rest, you can choose one specialization from the following list.

_**Ferrosist.**_ Whenever you make a Strength check or saving throw to resist the effects of iron or steel Allomancy, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

_**Mentalist.**_ Whenever you make a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw to resist the effects of zinc or brass Allomancy, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

_**Physicalist.**_ When you are hit by an attack empowered by tin or pewter Allomancy, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

If you use your Detect Allomancy feature and detect a form of Allomancy on this list, you can replace your current specialization with the one you detected.

#### Bronze Flare

Starting at 2nd Focus level, you can flare bronze. Whenever you spend charges of bronze, you can instead spend 4 times as many charges to flare it.

If you flare bronze to use your Detect Allomancy feature, your seeking range is doubled for the duration.

#### Natural Hunter

At 2nd Focus level, you gain proficiency in the Survival skill. If you are already proficient in this skill, you can double your proficiency bonus.

#### Relentless Hunter

Beginning at 3rd Focus level, you hunt your quarry with perseverance. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 charge to place a Bronze Mark on a creature you can see within 60 feet. The Mark lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) or place a Mark on another creature. If you flare bronze to use this feature, you can place a Mark on two creatures instead.

You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to find and track Marked creatures.

Whenever you hit a creature you have Marked with a weapon attack, you deal 1d6 bonus weapon damage. At the end of each of your turns, if you have dealt bonus damage this way, the bonus increases by 1d6, up to a maximum of 2d6. The maximum bonus damage increases to 3d6 at 11th Focus level and 4d6 at 18th Focus level. When the creature is no longer Marked, the bonus resets to 1d6.

#### Improved Burn

When you reach 3rd Focus level, you burn your metals more efficiently. While out of combat, spending 1 charge of bronze to detect Allomancy will last 1 minute. This increases 10 minutes at 7th Focus level and 10 minutes at 15th Focus level.

#### Hunter’s Shadow

At 7th Focus level, when you have detected a creature with bronze, you and your group have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to evade the creature.
