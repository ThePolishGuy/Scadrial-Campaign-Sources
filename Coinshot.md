### Scadrial handbook

Allomancer who burn steel gain the ability to push all metal except aluminum away from themselves. Known as Coinshots, they are often seen soaring through city skylines by levitating on their metalpushes.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Weapons:** Dueling canes, hand crossbows, longswords, shortswords.
-   **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
-   **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Spot, and Hide.

#### Metalpush

Beginning at 1st Focus level, you can burn steel as detailed by your Allomancy feature to metalpush metal objects away from you. You can spend 1 charge as an action to push on one metal object within range, such as a vial of metals, a metal weapon, a suit of metal armor, or a cooking tool. The resulting effect varies based on the Weight difference between you and the object, as shown in the Metalpush Interactions table. You cannot pull on aluminum or metals inside a body.

Some Metalpush effects require targets make a saving throw. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Metalpush save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

At 1st Focus level, your Metalpush range is 30 feet. This range increases to 40 feet at 7th level.

#### Metalsense

Starting at 1st Focus level, you have Metalsense up to 120 feet as long as you are able to burn steel with your Metalpush feature. You can sense the presence of all metals except aluminum within the specified range. It appears as translucent lines radiating from the chest towards metal, and creatures with this ability have advantage on Spot checks made to find specific metal objects.

| Two or more weight classes lighter than you                   | If the object is not being worn, you can metalpush it in a straight line away from you. The object is moved up to a number of feet equal to your Metalpush range. If the object being held, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop the object, and you metalpush it as described.     A creature in the path of this object must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. When the object hits a creature, you immediately stop metalpushing it and it falls to the ground.     If a creature is wearing the object, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s choice of Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, knocking the creature prone on a success. Alternatively, the creature may use a reaction to remove the object if it does not take longer than one action to do so (DM’s discretion). You have advantage on this check if the creature is one weight class lighter than you and you automatically succeed if the creature is two or more weight classes lighter. Conversely, you have disadvantage if the creature is one weight class heavier than you and you automatically fail if the creature is two or more weight classes heavier. |
| Within one weight class of you                                | If the object is not being worn or carried, you metalpush the object towards you across the ground, up to a distance equal to half your Metalpush range. If the object being held, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop the object, and you metalpush it as described.    If the object is being worn, the creature must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet towards you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Two or more weight classes heavier than you, or is immovable  | You fly in a straight line away from the object. If you travel more than twice your speed in a single turn and collide with a hard surface, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every additional 10 feet you moved up to a maximum of 20d6, provided gravity or a Dexterity-based maneuver has not reduced your impact (DM’s discretion). If you are wearing heavy armor, moving this way costs two feet of movement for every foot moved.    If a creature is in your path, you stop at the first unoccupied space in front of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### Steel Flare

At 2nd Focus level, you can flare steel. Whenever you spend charges of steel, you can instead spend 4 times as many charges to flare it. Until the end of your turn, you have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws you make when you use your Metalpush feature.

When you flare steel to use your Metalpull feature to target an object, you can target one additional object as part of the same action, provided you are not using an steel technique.

#### Coinshot

Starting at 2nd Focus level, you can shoot tiny metal objects like coins or nails at lethal speeds. As an action, you can draw a coin (range 30/60) and spend 1 charge to shoot it at a creature you can see. Make a ranged attack. On a hit, it deals bludgeoning damage equal to your Dexterity modifier + 1d6 for each coin fired. At the end of combat, you can recover half the coins you fired by searching the combat area.

The number of coins you can fire increases to two at 7th level. If you flare steel to use this technique, the d6 damage dice become d12s.

Steel Technique Starting at 3rd Focus level, you learn new ways to metalpush. You learn three techniques of your choice:
-   _**Buoyant.**_ While your Metalsense is active, your base move speed increases by 10 feet.
-   _**Charging Tackle.**_ When you metalpush yourself towards a creature and stop within 5 feet of it, you can attempt to shove the creature as an action. You make this check with advantage. On a success, you choose whether the creature is either knocked prone or pushed 15 feet away from you.
-   _**Coin Spray.**_ You can spend 2 charges as an action to launch a spray of 20 tiny metal objects in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 bludgeoning on a failure and half as much on a success. If you flare steel to use this technique, the d6 damage dice become d12s.
-   _**Coin Dodge.**_ When you are subject to a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 charge and 1 tiny metal object to gain advantage on the save.
-   _**Extra Coin.**_ You can use a bonus action to fire one tiny metal object as detailed in the Coinshot feature.
-   _**Locksmith.**_ You can attempt to manipulate a lock’s tumblers with a metalpush. When you try to pick a metal lock, you can spend 1 charge to gain advantage on the check.
-   _**Magnet Bomb.**_ As an action, you can spend 2 charges to target every metal object of your choice within 5 feet of you with a metalpush.
-   _**Magnet Ward.**_ If you are hit by an attack made with a metal object, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to reduce the damage taken by 1d4. This increases to 2d4 at 7th Focus level. If you flare steel to use this technique, you roll twice as many dice instead for the damage reduction.
-   _**Metal Punch.**_ While holding a piece of metal, you empower your punches with a slight metalpush. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier and its speed is reduced by 10 until the end of its next turn.
-   _**Nudge.**_ You can use a bonus action instead of an action to metalpush a Floatweight metal object within range.
-   _**Repelling Fall.**_ When you are falling, you can use a reaction to drop a metal object against the surface below and slow your fall. You take no fall damage.
-   _**Steel Bolt.**_ As a bonus action, you drop a metal object and spend 1 charge to metalpush yourself up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
-   _**Steel Dash.**_ You can spend 1 charge as a bonus action to metalpush on a metal object two or more weight classes heavier than you, and you fly in a straight line up to your speed away from it. If you flare steel to use this technique, you can fly up to twice your speed instead.
-   _**Violent Push.**_ You can metalpush objects farther up to an additional 30 feet. 
You learn an additional technique at 7th level. Each time you gain a level in this subclass, you can also replace one technique you already know with a different one.

#### One Step Ahead

Starting at 3rd Focus level, when a creature ends its movement within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to 10 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity.

#### Steel Flight

When you reach 7th level, metalpushing becomes natural to you for mobility. As part of your movement, you can spend 1 charge to metalpush on a metal object two or more weight classes heavier than you and fly up to your speed away it in a straight line. If you flare iron to use this feature, you can fly up to twice your speed in that direction.
