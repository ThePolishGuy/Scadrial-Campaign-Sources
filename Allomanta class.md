## Allomancer

Perched on an iron spire against the full moon, a figure peers into the darkness of his city, catching quick glimpses of people and their conversations below.

Guided by levitative pushes of steel, a woman streaks through the air with her mistcloak fluttering, firing coin after coin at the unnatural koloss brutes, piercing their flesh with sickening splashes.

Burning with an unnatural rage, throngs of villagers storm their master’s castle, spreading unrestrained destruction as a man smiles and carefully riots their anger into a seething crescendo.

Whether pushing their bodies beyond the physical limits or altering the pace of time, Allomancers are forces of nature that can shape the course of history through their quest for power, glory, or revolution. They are not all adventurers and heroes, but it is all but guaranteed that every legend will always have one.

### Power of Preservation

Allomancers get their power through a special connection to the Shard of Preservation. By ingesting and “burning” certain metals, Allomancers focus their connection to Preservation, who grants them abilities in return.

Allomancers who can burn only one metal are called Mistings, whereas Allomancers that can burn all metals are called Mistborn. Normally, an Allomancer can either burn one or all metals, but Mistings can be granted the ability to burn more metals through Hemalurgy.

Allomancy is hereditary – throughout the Final Empire, it was restricted to nobility by the Lord Ruler. Allomancy is awakened when the Allomancer undergoes heavy emotional or physical stress. This event triggers a crack in the soul that allows them to use that power.

Allomancers tend to prefer non-metallic armor and weaponry to avoid the influence of Steel Metalpushes or Iron Metalpulls. However, metals inside the body, whether pierced or ingested, cannot be affected by other Allomancers.

### Creating an Allomancer

Allomancers come from all spectra of alignment. As you build your character, think about their connection with the power. Allomancy is strongly tied to nobility and the Lord Ruler, which actively affects the Allomancer’s life.

Your character may have inherited noble blood, but your motivations can vary. You may be the illegitimate offspring of a noble and a commoner, hidden from the empire for safety. Perhaps you still serve the Lord Ruler and seek to restore the old social order. You may have stumbled upon a dark secret about your fellow ruling class and vowed to disown the symbol of your status.

#### Quick Build

You can make an Allomancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Dexterity, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the Urchin background. For your subclass Focus, choose Tin.

## Handbook

As an Allomancer, you gain the following class features. Different subclasses of Allomantic Focus will grant additional class features.

#### Hit Points
-   **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per Allomancer level
-   **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
-   **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per Allomancer level after 1st.
#### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

-   (a) Any weapon you are proficient with, or (b) a shield
-   (a) Leather armor, (b) ballistic vest armor if proficient, or (c) obsidian mail armor if proficient.
-   (a) A shortbow and 20 stone arrows or (b) two stone handaxes
-   An explorer's pack and 4 small metal vials filled with your choice of metals

## Allomancy

At 1st level, your heritage allows you to burn and activate the power from metals in your stomach. These metals must have a specific purity or chemical composition.

#### Metal Charges

Your Allomantic abilities are represented by a number of charges. If you have the ability to burn multiple metals, each metal is represented by its own charge. You can spend these charges to fuel your powers.

As an action, you can ingest a vial of metals to regain charges in that metal. The maximum amount of charges you can hold in your body increases as you gain levels in Allomancy as shown on the Allomancer table.

#### Burning Metals

Your choice of Allomantic Focus allows you to burn specific metals. When you burn that metal in your stomach, you are spending metal charges to activate special abilities. Some metals grant you benefits while you are burning them and others only require that you burn the metal as part of an action to use an ability. You immediately stop burning metals if you have no metals left, if you fall unconscious, or if you are affected by the draining effects of aluminum or chromium.

**Flaring Metals.** Flaring is a stronger form of burning. While flaring, you use up more charges, but the effects of your abilities are more powerful. When flaring a metal, you are still considered to be burning it.

**Improper Metals.** If you attempt to burn a metal that you cannot burn, or a metal that is improperly mixed, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.

#### Metal Poisoning

If you have charges remaining at the end of a long rest, the metal poisons you and you suffer from exhaustion based on the number of charges you have remaining, as shown on the table below.

| Charges Remaining | Levels of Exhaustion |
|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|
|        1-2        |           1          |
|        3-5        |           2          |
|        6-9        |           3          |
|     10 or more    |           4          |

## Allomancy Style

At 3rd level, you develop a particular style of Allomancy as your specialty. Choose an Allomancy Style from the list of optional features. You can't take the same option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

#### Blade Flurry

While you are dual-wielding two daggers with the light property, you can make an additional attack whenever you take the attack action.

#### Cache

You can use an action to keep a charge of metal in your mouth and ingest it whenever you spend charges. This charge cannot be affected by Allomantic Pushes or Pulls because it is in your body.

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Scout

You have advantage on spot rolls and cannot be surprised.

#### Survivor

While you have no charges remaining, you have a +1 bonus to your AC.

## Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Metal Reserve

At 9th level, your body becomes adapted to a Focus metal of your choice. When you finish a long rest with 2 charges of the chosen metals remaining, you do not suffer the side effects of metal poisoning.

## Rapid Recharge

Beginning at 10th level, you can ingest the contents of a small vial as a bonus action instead of an action.

## Allomantic Focuses

As an Allomancer, you are either a Misting or a Mistborn. Mistings can only burn one type of metal whereas Mistborn can burn all of them. This specialization is represented by your Focus, which grants you additional features. Each Focus may also grant you additional proficiencies and equipment.

When you gain a level in Allomancy, you gain a level in your chosen Focus. If you are a Mistborn, you follow a different set of rules detailed in the Mistborn Focus section.

Of the sixteen standard metals and three god metals, only ten are fully developed into subclasses, which are presented in this section organized into their pairs with their counterpart metals. The remaining metals are considered impractical for a character, but some of their features are detailed in the Optional Focuses section at the end of the Allomancer class.
