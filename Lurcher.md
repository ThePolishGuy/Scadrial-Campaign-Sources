## Handbook

Allomancers who burn iron gain the ability to pull all metals except aluminum towards themselves. Known as Lurchers, they often work in teams with their Coinshot counterparts to push and pull metals. More adventurous Lurchers enjoy flying through cities by pulling on buildings up to dangerous heights.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Armor:** Medium armor, heavy armor, shields
-   **Weapons:** Martial weapons, shields
-   **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
-   **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth

#### Metalpull

Beginning at 1st Focus level, you can burn iron as detailed by your Allomancy feature to metalpull metal objects toward you. You can spend 1 charge as an action to pull on one metal object within range, such as a vial of metals, a metal weapon, a suit of metal armor, or a cooking tool. The resulting effect varies based on the Weight difference between you and the object, as shown in the Metalpull Interactions table. You cannot pull on aluminum or metals inside a body.

Some Metalpull effects require targets make a saving throw. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Metalpull save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +

your Strength modifier

At 1st Focus level, your Metalpull range is 30 feet. This range increases to 40 feet at 7th level.

#### Metalsense

Starting at 1st Focus level, you have Metalsense up to 120 feet as long as you are able to burn iron with your Metalpull feature. You can sense the presence of all metals except aluminum within the specified range. It appears as translucent lines radiating from the chest towards metal, and creatures with this ability have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to find specific metal objects.

| Two or more weight classes lighter than you                  	| If the object is not being worn, you can metalpush it in a straight line away from you. The object is moved up to a number of feet equal to your Metalpush range. If the object being held, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop the object, and you metalpush it as described.     A creature in the path of this object must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. When the object hits a creature, you immediately stop metalpushing it and it falls to the ground.     If a creature is wearing the object, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s choice of Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, knocking the creature prone on a success. Alternatively, the creature may use a reaction to remove the object if it does not take longer than one action to do so (DM’s discretion). You have advantage on this check if the creature is one weight class lighter than you and you automatically succeed if the creature is two or more weight classes lighter. Conversely, you have disadvantage if the creature is one weight class heavier than you and you automatically fail if the creature is two or more weight classes heavier. |
| Within one weight class of you                               	| If the object is not being worn or carried, you metalpush the object towards you across the ground, up to a distance equal to half your Metalpush range. If the object being held, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop the object, and you metalpush it as described.    If the object is being worn, the creature must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet towards you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Two or more weight classes heavier than you, or is immovable 	| You fly in a straight line away from the object. If you travel more than twice your speed in a single turn and collide with a hard surface, you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every additional 10 feet you moved up to a maximum of 20d6, provided gravity or a Dexterity-based maneuver has not reduced your impact (DM’s discretion). If you are wearing heavy armor, moving this way costs two feet of movement for every foot moved.    If a creature is in your path, you stop at the first unoccupied space in front of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### Iron Flare

Starting at 2nd Focus level, you can flare iron. Whenever you spend iron charges, you can instead spend 4 times as many charges to flare it. Until the end of your turn, you have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws you make when you use your Metalpull feature.

When you flare iron to use your Metalpull feature to target an object, you can target one additional object as part of the same action, provided you are not using an iron technique.

#### Deflector Plate

At 2nd Focus level, you gain a lurcher plate, a thick piece of wood and leather designed to absorb heavy blows to the chest. You are proficient with this plate. When you are hit by an attack you can see, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d4. If the is made with a metal object, you can spend 1 charge to roll 1d10 instead.

The damage reduction increases at higher levels. You roll two dice at 7th level. If you flare iron to use this feature, you double the number of dice you roll.

#### Iron Technique

Starting at 3rd Focus level, you learn new ways to metalpull. You know three techniques of your choice:

-   _**Anchor.**_ You can use a bonus action to shift into a stable stance. You count as one weight class heavier and one size larger until the start of your next turn.
-   _**Arms of Iron.**_ When you metalpull yourself towards a creature and stop within 5 feet of it, you can attempt to grapple it as a bonus action. You make this check with advantage. On a success, you deal the creature is grappled and takes 1d6 bonus bludgeoning damage.
-   _**Full Heave.**_ You can spend 2 charges as an action and target every metal object of your choice within a 15-foot cone with your metalpull.
-   _**Iron Curtain.**_ When an allied creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made with a metal object you can see, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to grant it the benefits of your Deflector Plate feature.
-   _**Iron Dash.**_ You can spend 1 charge as a bonus action to metalpull a metal object two or more weight classes heavier than you within range, and you fly towards it up to your speed in a straight line. If you flare iron to use this technique, you can fly up to twice your speed instead.
-   _**Lethal Spear.**_ You can spend 1 charge as an action to violently metalpull on a coin-sized Floatweight object within range, and you can catch it provided you have a free hand. Each creature in the object’s path must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage. If you flare iron to use this technique, you roll twice as many damage dice.
-   _**Magnetic Fingers.**_ You gain proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill. If you are already proficient in this skill, you double your proficiency bonus.
-   _**Metalwalk.**_ You can spend 1 charge as a bonus action to walk on vertical metal surfaces for 1 minute at no cost to your speed. You cannot be wearing heavy armor to use this feature. If you flare iron to use this feature, you can also walk upside-down on metal surfaces for the duration.
-   _**Quick Draw.**_ You can use a bonus action instead of an action to metalpull a Floatweight metal object within range and you can catch it provided you have a free hand.
-   _**Plate Protector.**_ When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. The attack does not need to include metal.
-   _**Prospector’s Reach.**_ Your base Metalpull range increases by 10 feet.
-   _**Secret Strike.**_ When you use your Metalpull feature and successfully deal damage to a creature with an object collision, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it has disadvantage on its next attack roll. If you flare iron to use this technique, the creature has disadvantage on the save. This technique cannot be used in combination with another technique.

You learn an additional iron technique at the 7th level. Each time you gain a level in this subclass, you can also replace one technique you already know with a different one.

#### Bulwark of Battle

Starting at 3rd Focus level, while you are wearing your Lurcher Plate, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

#### Iron Flight

When you reach 7th Focus level, metalpulling becomes natural to you for mobility. As part of your movement, you can spend 1 charge to metalpull on a metal object two or more weight classes heavier than you and fly up to your speed towards it. If you flare iron to use this feature, you can fly up to twice your speed in that direction.
