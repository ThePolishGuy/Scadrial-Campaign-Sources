## Handbook

Allomancers who burn pewter have increased physical strength, speed, durability, and balance. Colloquially called Thugs, Pewterarms serve as primarily as enforcers or soldiers due to their physical prowess.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Armor:** Medium armor, shields
-   **Weapons:** Martial weapons
-   **Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution
-   **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, Animal Handling, Intimidation, Nature, and Survival

#### Pewter Burn

At 1st Focus level, you can burn pewter as detailed by your Allomancy feature. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 charge and start burn pewter. While burning pewter, you gain the following benefits:

-   You have a +2 bonus to damage rolls made with a melee weapon and a +2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity checks. This bonus increases to +3 at 7th Focus Level, and +4 at 15th Focus Level.
-   Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

To continue burning pewter, you must spend 1 charge at the start of each turn, which lasts until you end it early (no action required), have no charges remaining, or die. When it ends, you must use another bonus action to start burning pewter again.

#### Pewter Flare

Starting at 2nd Focus level, you can flare pewter for additional power. While burning pewter on your turn, you may choose to spend 3 charges (no action required) and increase it to a flare, which lasts until the start of your next turn. While flaring pewter, you gain the following benefits:

-   The bonus to your damage rolls, Strength checks, and Dexterity checks for burning pewter is doubled.
-   Your walking speed increases by an additional 10 feet.

#### Undying Spirit

Beginning at 2nd Focus level, while you are burning pewter, you ignore the negative effects of exhaustion.

When you begin a short or long rest, you can choose to sleep and burn pewter to recover from exhaustion. At the end of the rest, you can remove one additional level of exhaustion for each charge of pewter you spend.

#### Mighty Attacks

Beginning at 3rd Focus level, you can throw all of your strength into your attacks. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack with all your might. Doing so gives you advantage on your attacks until the end of your turn, and then you gain one level of exhaustion.

#### Pewter Recovery

Starting at 3rd Focus level, you can use a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to your Focus level + your Constitution modifier, and you gain one level of exhaustion.

#### Dauntless Strength

Beginning at 7th Focus level, whenever you fail a check or saving throw using Strength or Constitution, you can choose to re-roll the die and use the new result. You then gain one level of exhaustion.
