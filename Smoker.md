## Handbook

Allomancers who burn copper can prevent the detection of Allomancy within range. Due to their critical but single-purpose ability, they often take up other responsibilities like in preparations and leadership. No crew is complete without a Smoker to mask them from hunters.

#### First Level Proficiencies

When you choose this Focus at 1st character level, you gain the following proficiencies:

-   **Armor:** Medium armor, heavy armor, shields
-   **Weapons:** Martial weapons
-   **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
-   **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival.

#### Coppercloud

Starting at 1st Focus level, you can burn copper as detailed by your Allomancy feature. You can spend 1 charge as a bonus action to create a coppercloud, which is an invisible 10-foot radius sphere centered on you where Allomancy cannot be detected. The coppercloud moves with you and lasts for 1 minute, or until you end it early as a bonus action, create a new coppercloud, fall unconscious, or die.

While inside your coppercloud, a creature using Allomancy cannot be detected by creatures outside the cloud that use bronze Allomancy, though Allomancy can still be deduced through observation or other means. Conversely, creatures that use bronze Allomancy inside your coppercloud cannot detect Allomancy outside.

The radius of your coppercloud increases to 20 feet at 7th Focus level, 30 feet at 15th Focus level.

#### Copper Soul

Beginning at 1st Focus level, while you are burning copper, you have advantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of zinc and brass Allomancy. If you are charmed or frightened, you can immediately repeat the saving throw to end the effect.

#### Natural Leader

Starting at 1st Focus level, you easily lead your party on your travels. While traveling for more than an hour, your group can move stealthily at a normal pace and remains alert to danger even when engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking).

#### Copper Flare

Starting at 2nd Focus level, you can flare copper for additional power. On your turn, while your coppercloud is active, you may choose to spend 3 charges (no action required) and increase it to a flare, which lasts until the start of your next turn. While flaring copper, you gain the following benefits:

-   Your coppercloud’s range is doubled.
-   You have advantage on your attack rolls.
-   If a creature using bronze Allomancy attempts to pierce your flared coppercloud, you can make a Deception (Charisma) check to contest the creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check. You have advantage on the check if you are in another creature’s coppercloud.

#### Copper Blitz

Starting at 3rd Focus level, your copperclouds can empower your allies in battle. When you first create a coppercloud, each allied creature inside it deals an additional 1d8 weapon damage on the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn.

#### Smoker’s Rally Cry

Beginning at 3rd Focus level, you can bolster your allies in your coppercloud. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can spend 1 charge of copper use one of the following rally cries:

_**Fall into Position.**_ Each allied creature of your choice in your coppercloud can use its reaction move up to half its speed in a direction of your choice.

_**Flanking Maneuver.**_ One allied creature of your choice can use its reaction to make one melee attack against the creature you hit.

_**Hold The Line.**_ Each allied creature of your choice in your coppercloud can use its reaction to make an attack of opportunity against any creature that first enters its reach.

#### Improved Burn

When you reach 7th Focus level, you burn your metals more efficiently. While out of combat, your coppercloud lasts 10 minutes instead of 1 minute.
